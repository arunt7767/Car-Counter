Real-Time Vehicle Counter with Computer Vision

Overview

This project is a real-time vehicle counter that uses computer vision to detect and count vehicles in a video stream. It leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model for vehicle detection and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for tracking. The project is designed to count various types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes, and it displays the count in real-time on the video feed.

Features

Object Detection: Utilizes the YOLO model to identify and classify vehicles in a video stream.
Real-Time Tracking: Employs the SORT algorithm for tracking and maintaining vehicle identity.
Counting Logic: Accurately counts vehicles that cross a defined point in the video.
Visualization: Displays the vehicle count in real-time on the video feed.
Customization: Provides flexibility to adjust detection and tracking parameters.
Performance: Optimized for real-time processing and accuracy.
Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Ultralytics YOLO
SORT
A pre-trained YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv3) and corresponding configuration files.
A video input source (e.g., a video file).
Setup

Clone or download this project repository.
Install the required Python libraries and dependencies using pip.
Download the pre-trained YOLO model and configuration files.
Specify the path to the YOLO model, configuration, video source, and other resources in the code.
Usage

Run the Python script to start the real-time vehicle counting application.
The application will process the video source, detect and track vehicles, and display the vehicle count in real-time.
You can adjust the parameters, such as confidence thresholds and tracking settings, as needed.
Configuration

model: Specify the path to the pre-trained YOLO model and configuration files.
classNames: Define the class names for object detection (e.g., "car," "truck," "bus," "motorbike").
mask: Load a mask image to limit the region of interest (ROI) for vehicle counting.
tracker: Configure SORT tracking parameters such as maximum age and minimum hits.
limits: Set the line coordinates for counting vehicles that cross a specific point in the video.
Results

The application will display the video stream with bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
The vehicle count will be updated in real-time on the video feed.
Vehicle identities will be tracked and displayed.
